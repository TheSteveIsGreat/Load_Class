# load-class
This project uses the following skills: pointers, dynamic memory allocation, inheritance, polymorphism, classes, containers, file I/O, formatting output, structures, exceptions, nested classes, and static data members.

In this activity I created a base class, ShippingItem, and three subclasses: Carton, Flat, and Tube. Then I created a Load class that manages an entire truckload of shipping items to be delivered.
